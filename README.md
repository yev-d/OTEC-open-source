# OTEC-open-source
An open source Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) project.

Hi, my name is Yev. I am looking for collaborators to work with on a marine/mechanical/civil engineering project, [OTEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion). The OTEC plant I am aiming at is an off-shore grazing type. If you are one of the following, please get in touch with me and let us self organize to tackle the climate change and energy crisis together:
* Mechanical/Civil/Chemical/Marine engineer with some spare time
* Mechanical/Civil/Chemical/Marine engineering student wishing to contribute and learn
* Master's/Doctorate students wishing to contribute or share the expertise
* Hobbyist in of above-mentioned disciplines
* Expert in heat exchangers/pumps/pipeline willing to contribute

Please contact me either [here on the discussion board](https://github.com/yev-d/OTEC-open-source/discussions/1) or via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yev-d-0344855a/

## Expectations

To develop a robust concept design for an offshore grazing OTEC Plant. The plant should be modular. A 500kW to 1MW capacity. To be easily integratable with other modular plants to grow the capacity. Have low capital investment. Ideally, the plant shall output electricity only. The Hydrogen, Ammonia or other byproducts shall be done in separate modules, depending on the user's needs.

Below is the suggestion for the design besis.
