An open source Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) project.

Hi, my name is Yev. I am looking for collaborators to work with on a marine/mechanical/civil engineering project, [OTEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion). The OTEC plant I am aiming at is an off-shore grazing type. If you are one of the following, please get in touch with me and let us self organize to tackle the climate change and energy crisis together:
* Mechanical/Civil/Chemical/Marine engineer with some spare time
