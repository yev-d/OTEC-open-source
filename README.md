# OTEC-open-source

An open-source Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) project.

Hi, my name is Yev. I am looking for collaborators to work with on a marine/mechanical/civil engineering project, [OTEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion) plant of an off-shore grazing type. If you are one of the following, please get in touch with me and let us self-organize to tackle the climate change and energy crisis together:

* Mechanical/Civil/Chemical/Marine engineer with some spare time
* Mechanical/Civil/Chemical/Marine engineering student wishing to contribute and learn
* Master's/Doctorate students wishing to contribute or share the expertise
* Hobbyists in the disciplines mentioned above
* Expert in heat exchangers/pumps/pipeline willing to contribute

Please contact me either [here on the discussion board](https://github.com/yev-d/OTEC-open-source/discussions/1#discussion-4121236) or via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yev-d-0344855a/

If you haven't heard about the OTEC Plant or need a refresher, head over here for a brief [OTEC Plant 101](https://github.com/yev-d/OTEC-open-source/blob/faed2eac8a5f5c1297273f6227dcf2dd2ea728ff/OTEC-Plant-101.md). 

## Expectations

To develop a robust concept design for an offshore grazing OTEC Plant. The plant should be modular. A 500kW to 1MW capacity. To be easily integratable with other modular plants to grow the capacity. Have low capital investment. Ideally, the plant shall output electricity only. The Hydrogen, Ammonia or other byproducts shall be done in separate modules, depending on the user's needs.

The water intake depth = 800 to 1000m
The water outlet depth = 150 to 200m (to have negligible effects on the marine environment)

Below is the suggestion for the design basis.

## In brief

OTEC plants can be subdivided into the following seven technologies [[Reference: Technical Readiness of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)]](https://github.com/yev-d/OTEC-open-source/blob/main/Literature%20Review/PDF/2009-11_Technical%20Readiness%20of%20Ocean%20Thermal%20Energy%20Conversion%20(OTEC)%20Nov-2009.pdf).
