# OTEC Plant 101

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC for short) plant is based on heat pump principles. The Rankine thermodynamic cycle is the basis of the OTEC plant design. The cycle may be open or closed.

**Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)** – is the closed type OTEC plant.

**Kalina Cycle** – is a modified ORC that is suitable for low-temperature delta. Working fluid in the Kalina cycle is a mixture of ammonia and
water.

**SOTEC** – is a Solar-boosted OTEC. It uses solar power thermal
collectors to warm up the seawater. This increases OTEC efficiency by ~10%

**Closed Cycle** – working fluid is heated by warm surface water in the evaporator. Steam is produced, driving the turbine. Working fluid drives the turbine. Then the steam condensed by the cold water and returned to the evaporator to start all over. A typical working fluid is Ammonia.

**Open Cycle** – the working fluid is seawater water. Cold seawater (under pressure) is brought up and warmed by the warm surface water. Steam is created. The turbine is driven by the steam of seawater. Desalination of the seawater is a by-product of this process. That is why open cycle or hybrid is an attractive option for coastal and island communities.
